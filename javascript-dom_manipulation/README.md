## ESLint: config added manually

    > since last version is installed and "env" key is part of the older ESLint config system, not used in the new flat config format

```
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  }
}
```

My code is done to handle 'func-names' rule without disabling it for a better learning process and good coding practices by using arrow function or named function expression.
