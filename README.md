# HBnB Evolution Project Overview
<a name="HBnB Evolution Project Overview"></a>


> See Repository > Soon available!


## Project Description


The HBnB Evolution project is a comprehensive educational initiative designed to guide students through\
the development of a simplified AirBnB-like application. 

Spanning four stages, the project progresses from backend setup to full-stack integration and deployment,\
using **Docker** and various modern development practices.

An API-first approach is prioritized, focusing on establishing a robust and scalable API before frontend implementation.

&nbsp;

## Architectural Approach and Methodology

**The architecture of HBnB Evolution employs a three-layered approach:**

***Service Layer:***\
Manages all API endpoints, serving as the interface between the client and business logic.\
Business Logic Layer: Houses models and business rules, handling data logic, validation, and computations.\

***Persistence Layer:***\
Oversees data storage and retrieval, initially using simple class implementations with interfaces for adaptability,\
allowing for easy transition to more complex storage solutions.\

**Stage 1:**\
*Backend Setup and Basic Functionality*\
<br>
*Objectives:*\
- Develop a UML model and implement backend functionality using Flask.\
- Create data persistence using simple classes, facilitated by interfaces for future flexibility.\
- Develop RESTful API endpoints.\
- Containerize the API using Docker.  
<br>
*Key Entities and Attributes:*\
- User:\
Attributes include id (UUID4), email (String), first_name (String), last_name (String),
created_at (DateTime), and updated_at (DateTime).  
<br>
- Place:\
Attributes include id (UUID4), host_id (UUID4 referencing User), name (String), description (String), number_of_rooms (Integer), number_of_bathrooms (Integer), max_guests (Integer), price_per_night (Float), latitude (Float), longitude (Float), city_id (UUID4 referencing City), amenity_ids (List of UUIDs referencing Amenities), created_at (DateTime), and updated_at (DateTime).
<br>
- City:\
Attributes include id (UUID4), name (String), country_code (String referencing Country), created_at (DateTime), and updated_at (DateTime).  
- Country: Attributes include code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), name (String). This entity is preloaded and read-only.  
- Review: Attributes include id (UUID4), place_id (UUID4 referencing Place), user_id (UUID4 referencing User), rating (Integer),  
comment (String), created_at (DateTime), and updated_at (DateTime).

**Stage 2:**\
*Database Integration and Authentication*\
<br>
Objectives:\
- Transition to ORM-based interactions using SQLAlchemy, moving from simple storage to SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.  
- Introduce JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.  
- Update Docker configurations to include a production database and develop Docker Compose scripts for effective deployment.
<br>
**Stage 3:**\
*Frontend Development*
Objectives:\
- Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction with the backend.  
- Dockerize the frontend using Nginx to efficiently manage static file serving and API requests.  
<br>
**Stage 4:**\
*Full System Deployment*
Objectives:\
- Use Docker Compose for deploying multiple containers, including frontend, backend, and database services.  
- Set up Nginx for load balancing and ensure secure and scalable deployments through public and private networking configurations.
