## Learning Objectives:

### General

```
In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system. This approach allows for the easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.
Learning Objectives:

    HTTP/HTTPS Basics: Grasp the foundational principles of the web’s primary protocol, understanding how data transfer occurs, methods involved, and the difference between the secure and non-secure versions.

    API Consumption with Command Line: Hands-on experience in interacting with APIs using basic command-line tools, laying the groundwork for more advanced interactions.

    API Consumption with Python: Elevate your data fetching skills by leveraging Python’s capabilities, allowing for more advanced processing and data manipulation.

    API Development with http.server: Understand the basics of crafting an API from scratch using Python’s built-in modules, setting a solid foundation.

    API Development with Flask: Dive deeper into API development using the lightweight Flask framework, focusing on routing, data management, and scalability.

    API Security & Authentication: Address the crucial aspect of security, understanding how to protect data transfer and ensure only authorized access to resources.

    API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI: Conclude with the importance of maintaining standardized documentation, ensuring that APIs are usable, understandable, and maintainable.

Importance:

In our interconnected digital age, RESTful APIs play a pivotal role in the integration of different systems. They serve as the middlemen, translating requests into understandable actions, fetching data, or triggering procedures. From social media platforms sharing data with advertisement agencies to complex industrial systems communicating with each other for automation, APIs are ubiquitous.

Developing a solid understanding of how to consume, develop, secure, and document these APIs equips you with a critical skill set. It’s a blend of understanding both the technical intricacies and the larger design picture, ensuring seamless and efficient communication in the digital world.

  Client            Web Server           API Server           Database

Components:

    Client: The requester of the service, often a web browser or application.
    Web Server: Handles the incoming request, acts as a middleman before passing it to the API server.
    API Server: The actual logic layer that processes the request, determining what data or action is required.
    Database: Stores the data which the API might fetch or modify.

Flow:

    The client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the Web Server.
    The Web Server, after potential routing and load balancing, forwards the request to the API Server.
    The API Server processes the request, interacts with the database if needed.
    The API Server returns the processed response to the Web Server.
    The Web Server sends back the final HTTP/HTTPS response to the client.

This diagram provides a high-level view of how RESTful API communication typically works. In simpler setups, the Web Server and API Server might be combined into one. The separation here illustrates potential layers in a more complex or scaled environment.

## Tasks 0:

```
Background:

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It allows web clients (like browsers) to communicate with web servers. HTTP has evolved over time and has a secure counterpart called HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS is just like HTTP but with an added layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption. This layer protects the data from eavesdroppers and tampering.
Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

    Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS.
    Understand the basic working and structure of HTTP requests and responses.
    Recognize and explain the common HTTP methods and status codes.
```


## Tasks 1:

```
Background:

curl (Client URL) is a command-line tool that allows users to transfer data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more). It’s widely used for debugging, testing, and interacting with RESTful web services and APIs. By mastering curl, one can quickly prototype API requests, diagnose server issues, and more, all from the command line.
Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

    Install and use curl from the command line.
    Construct and execute basic API requests using curl, including setting headers and inspecting the output.
    Interpret the results of common API requests.
```

```

## Tasks 3:

```
Background:

The http.server module in Python’s standard library provides basic classes for implementing web servers. While it’s not typically used for production applications, it’s a handy tool for building simple web servers and understanding the basics of web programming without relying on third-party libraries.
Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

    Set up a basic web server using the http.server module.
    Handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
    Serve JSON data in response to specific endpoints
```

## Tasks 4:

```
Background:

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, which is especially popular for creating small to medium web applications and RESTful APIs. Its minimalist and modular approach makes it a great choice for beginners to delve into web development without the overhead of more complex frameworks.
Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to: 1. Set up a Flask application and run a development server. 2. Define and handle routes with Flask to respond to different endpoints. 3. Serve JSON data using Flask. 4. Understand the basics of request handling and response formation in Flask. 5. Handle POST requests to add new data to the API.
```

## Tasks 5:

```
Background:

API security is of paramount importance, especially when the API is exposed to the wider internet. There are many risks, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and denial-of-service attacks. One fundamental method of securing APIs is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access certain resources.
Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

    Understand the importance of API security.
    Implement basic authentication using Flask.
    Set up token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    Differentiate between authentication and authorization.
