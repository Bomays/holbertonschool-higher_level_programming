## General

```
Why Python programming is awesome
What is OOP
“first-class everything”
What is a class
What is an object and an instance
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is an attribute
What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
What is self
What is a method
What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
What is a property
What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
What is a class attribute
What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
What is a class method
What is a static method
How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
How to bind attributes to object and classes
What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
